# self-learning-AI
<h3>Teaching myself AI and documenting the process</h3>
<h2>Day 1</h2>
Learnt what a **Perceptron** is, how it is defined, and the math behind a perceptron. Implemented a basic Perceptron in python and used it to fit data from the iris flowers dataset and see how the perceptron converges to a decision boundary. <br>

<h2>Day 2</h2>
Learnt what a **ADAptive LInear NEuron (adaline)** is, how it is defined, the math behind it, and the math behind **batch gradient descent** using an **Identity** activation function and **MSE loss**. Implemented a basic adaline in python and used it to fit data from the iris flowers dataset and looked at how the learning rate affects algorithm convergence. <br>
